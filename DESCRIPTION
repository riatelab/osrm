Description: An interface between R and the OSRM API. OSRM is a routing
    service based on OpenStreetMap data. See <http://project-osrm.org/> for more
    information. A public API exists but one can run its own instance. This package
    allows to compute distances (travel time and kilometric distance) between points
    and travel time matrices.
