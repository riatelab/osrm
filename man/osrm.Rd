\title{Shortest Paths and Travel Time from OpenStreetMap via an OSRM API}
\description{
An interface between R and the OSRM API. OSRM is a routing service
based on OpenStreetMap data. A public API exists but one can run its own instance.
The package allow to compute distance (travel time and kilometric distance)
between points and travel time matrices.
The package relies on the usage of a running OSRM service.\cr

By default this service is the OSRM public API (\url{http://router.project-osrm.org/}).

To change the OSRM server, change the \code{osrm.server} option:\cr
\code{options(osrm.server = "http://address.of.the.server/")}
}
