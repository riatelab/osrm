\title{Shortest Paths and Travel Time from OpenStreetMap via an OSRM API}
\description{
An interface between R and the OSRM API.\cr
OSRM is a routing
service based on OpenStreetMap data. See <http://project-osrm.org/> for more
information. This package
allows to compute distances (travel time and kilometric distance) between points
and travel time matrices.\cr
\itemize{
\item{\code{\link{osrmTable}} Get travel time matrices between points.}
\item{\code{\link{osrmRoute}} Get the shortest path between two points.}
\item{\code{\link{osrmTrip}} Get the travel geometry between multiple unordered points.}
\item{\code{\link{osrmIsochrone}} Get polygons of isochrones.}
}
}
\note{
This package relies on the usage of a running OSRM service (tested with 
version 5.23.0 of the OSRM API).\cr


To set the OSRM server, change the \code{osrm.server} option:\cr 
\code{options(osrm.server = "http://address.of.the.server/")} \cr\cr
To set the profile, use the \code{osrm.profile} option:\cr
\code{options(osrm.profile = "name.of.the.profile")}\cr
The "car" profile is set by default. Other possible profiles are "foot" and "bike".\cr\cr

A typical setup, corresponding to the Docker example, would be:\cr  
\code{options(osrm.server = "http://0.0.0.0:5000/", osrm.profile = "car")}
}
